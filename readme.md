This is a simple DNS Update script for Sitelutions. This one is written in python and gets its settings from a config file. The code is relatively simple and does just about the minimum it can. I threw this together one evening to have a dynamic DNS updater that fit my needs.

Take the example config file and replace the placeholders with your details. You then place it in ~/.config/slup.conf This script would ideally be run by cron.
